        "session cookie").
        <br><br>
        Session cookies are temporary cookies that are used during the course of your visit to the Website, and they
        expire when
        you close the web browser.

        All the cookies used are temporary and remain on your local computer only for the duration while you are on the
        website. No data is shared with any 3rd parties and all data is erased when you close your browser.</p>
